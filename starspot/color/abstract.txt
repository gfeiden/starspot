Abstract:
    After a pedagogical introduction to the main concepts of synthetic
    photometry, colours and bolometric corrections in the Johnson-Cousins,
    2MASS, and HST-ACS/WFC3 photometric systems are generated from MARCS
    synthetic fluxes for various [Fe/H] and [{alpha}/Fe] combinations, and
    virtually any value of E(B-V)<~0.7. The successes and failures of
    model fluxes in reproducing the observed magnitudes are highlighted.
    Overall, extant synthetic fluxes predict quite realistic broad-band
    colours and bolometric corrections, especially at optical and longer
    wavelengths: further improvements of the predictions for the blue and
    ultraviolet spectral regions await the use of hydrodynamic models
    where the microturbulent velocity is not treated as a free parameter.
    We show how the morphology of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD)
    changes for different values of [Fe/H] and [{alpha}/Fe]; in
    particular,how suitable colour combinations can easily discriminate
    between red giant branch and lower main sequence populations with
    different [{alpha}/Fe], due to the concomitant loops and swings in the
    CMD. We also provide computer programs to produce tables of synthetic
    bolometric corrections as well as routines to interpolate in them.
    These colour-Teff-metallicity relations may be used to convert
    isochrones for different chemical compositions to various bandpasses
    assuming observed reddening values, thus bypassing the standard
    assumption of a constant colour excess for stars of different spectral
    type.We also show how such an assumption can lead to significant
    systematic errors. The MARCS transformations presented in this study
    promise to provide important constraints on our understanding of the
    multiple stellar populations found in globular clusters (e.g., the
    colours of lower main sequence stars are predicted to depend strongly
    on [{alpha}/Fe]) and of those located towards/in the Galactic Bulge.
